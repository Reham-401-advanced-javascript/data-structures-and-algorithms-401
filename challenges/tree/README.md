# Trees
- A binary tree is a special type of tree in which every node or vertex has either no child node or one child node or two child nodes.
- A binary tree is an important class of a tree data structure in which a node can have at most two children.
## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Create a BinaryTree class
   - Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
   - Define a method named add and contains.
## Approach & Efficiency
preOrder() : O(n)
InOrder() :  O(n)
PostOrder() : O(n)
add() : add node to BinarySearchTree => O(n)
contains() : if exist => O(n)
